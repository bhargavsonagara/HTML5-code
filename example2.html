			Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside.
			<br> To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”
			<br>When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away.
			<br> But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf.<br> The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.
			“Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers,<br> “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down the hill.<br>

			Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again,<br> “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement,<br>
			
			he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.<br>

			As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly,<br>
			“Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’<br> 
			when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words <br>
			while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.<br>

			Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. <br>
			Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could,<br>
			“Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again,
			<br> and so they didn’t come to help.<br>

			At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. <br>
			When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, <br>
			‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.<br>

			An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, 
			<br>“Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”<br>
